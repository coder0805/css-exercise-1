        <h4>THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK       _Sir James M. Barrie_</h4>
        <p>Tradition
            MARY.
            It seems different; perhaps it's the night.
            OLLIVANT.
            I guess it isn't up to its usual standard. Haven't seen your
            mother there so often this spring.
            EMILY.
            [_Quietly._]
            This dry spell is not good for flowers.
            OLLIVANT.
            It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
            thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
            hill.
            [_Turning to_ EMILY _and patting her_.]
            Is there any of that spray
            mixture left, Emily, dear?</p>
